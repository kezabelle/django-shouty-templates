Change history for django-shouty-templates
------------------------------------------
0.1.4
^^^^^^
* Feature: the patch methods themselves (``new_resolve_lookup`` and ``new_url_render``) are skipped during rendering the debug error page. The exception message and functionality remain the same.
* Feature: exception messages now attempt to clarify what template name (loader relative) was rendering when the missing variable was encountered.
* Chore: Updated the ``mypy`` type signatures for some of the variables and methods to indicate the only values I'm expecting to accept.

0.1.3
^^^^^^
* Feature: Silenced errors when using `debug` or `sql_queries` in a template, as they're conditionally set by `django.template.context_processors.debug`

0.1.2
^^^^^^
* Feature: Added 11 new tokens to the default blacklist, covering more of the default Django admin and the default exception reporter.
* Bugfix: Changed the syntax of the `AppConfig.ready` method to be py2 type annotation compatible.

0.1.1
^^^^^^
* Initial release
